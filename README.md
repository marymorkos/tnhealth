# Mortality Patterns Analysis in Tennessee Counties (2019-2021) üìä

üîç **Welcome to the Mortality Patterns Analysis repository! Here, we delve into the complexity of mortality rates across Tennessee counties from 2019 to 2021. Our goal is to uncover insights into mortality patterns and identify key factors driving these variations. We employ a range of advanced predictive models to shed light on this critical public health issue.**

## Project Overview üìã
Mortality rates are a crucial indicator of a region's overall health and well-being. In this project, we explore mortality patterns in Tennessee counties over a three-year period, aiming to understand the underlying factors contributing to variations in mortality rates. By leveraging extensive datasets on mortality rates and demographics, we seek to provide actionable insights for healthcare policymakers and practitioners to inform targeted interventions and resource allocation strategies.

## Interactive Visualizations üìä
- **TN County Map:** Explore an interactive map of Tennessee counties, showcasing life expectancy for each county. This visualization provides valuable insights into regional disparities in mortality rates.
- **3D Plot:** Dive into an interactive 3D plot showcasing mortality rates across Tennessee counties over time. This visualization offers a unique perspective on temporal trends in mortality patterns.

## Key Results üìà
We've uncovered fascinating insights through our predictive modeling efforts. Here are the Mean Squared Error (MSE) values for some of our key models:

- **Linear Regression**
  - MSE: 0.9538
- **Gradient Boosting**
  - MSE: 0.4456
- **Random Forest**
  - MSE: 0.5510

These values serve as a testament to the predictive power of our models in capturing and understanding mortality patterns in Tennessee counties.
